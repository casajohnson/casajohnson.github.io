Who said that it’s only now that universities are taking student assessment seriously? A beloved older Jesuit here at Marquette University gave me his personal assessment-scheme for students, which he claims he has been using since the 1950’s. On a descending scale from 10 to 0, the scale measures the student’s knowledge.

### Significat numerus

| Numerus | Significat numerus                                           |
| ------  | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  10     | scientiam optimam et praeclarissimam                         |
|  9      | scientiam valde superiorem                                   |
|  8      | scientiam superiorem                                         |
|  7      | scientiam satis dignam                                       |
|  6      | scientiam minime dignam                                      |
|  5      | ignorantiam indignam                                         |
|  4      | ignorantiam reprehensibilem et intolerabilem                 |
|  3      | ignorantiam mirabilem                                        |
|  2      | ignorantiam incredibilem et vix possibilem                   |
|  1      | ignorantiam naturaliter impossibilem                         |
|  0      | negationem simplicem                                         |

All things old are new again.
