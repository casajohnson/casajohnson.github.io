So I’m typing an e-mail to a prospective PhD student and wanted to use the acronym PIMS (Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies [Toronto, Canada]), but wasn’t sure that this student would know what “PIMS” meant. Figuring that he might just punch in “PIMS” to a search engine, I fired up Safari, and typed in “PIMS” in the search field. The very first return was a nice and tidy PIMS hyperlink, with no further comment or description. Heartened by my efficiency, I clicked the link thinking, “well, the student will get what he needs easily enough.” But my clicked link brought me here:

{% include image image_path="/assets/images/posts/pims.png" alt="Picture of PIMS" caption="The PIMS website" %}

Whaaaaaaaa? I then noticed that the hyperlink was to [http://pims.edu](http://pims.edu/), and not my beloved [http://pims.ca](http://pims.ca/). Life is good.

PS: What do you think is in the Picture Gallery in the photo?
