With the end of the school year behind me I was able to scoot away—thanks, Norah—to hunker down for a week’s worth of serious manuscript and catalog work at St. John University’s Hill Museum and Manuscript Library (a.k.a., HMML). And they pronounce that acronym like _Himmel_, the German word for heaven. Gotta like that.

Everything about the visit was wonderful, especially staying at the Abbey Guesthouse, which was quiet and simple. The comfort food comforted, and urged me on to work. Thanks to all for a week that was memorable precisely because it was so predictable.
