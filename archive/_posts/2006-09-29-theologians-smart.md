Today is payday, so for a treat I swung by Starbucks on the way to work, to get a latte and some coffee for home.

> |  Me:       | “I’d like a grande latte, please, and this pound of ‘House Blend,’ ground up.”|
> |  Barista:  | “Yes, sir. (to Barista running the espresso-machine) Grande latte! … Oh, for the beans…what kind of coffee maker, sir?”|
> |  Me:      | “Conical-paper-drip, please.”                                         |
> |  Barista:      | “Wow. I haven’t heard the word ‘conical’ in, like, forever. Are you an engineer?”                                       |
> |  Me:      | “No. I’m a theologian.”                                      |
> |  Barista:      | “Wow.”                                         |

Whereupon I grabbed my latte, piled into the car, and started heading downtown to Marquette. Two miles into my trip, I realized that I had forgotten to wait for my coffee grounds.
