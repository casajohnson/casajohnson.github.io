Here at Marquette University we faculty enjoy generous borrowing privileges at our [two Libraries](http://www.marquette.edu/about/campus/libraries.shtml). Faculty are allowed to check out books for a year at a time, and renewing them is a snap. A while back I received an e-mail reminder from our Law School’s Library that I have a book checked-out that needed renewing. Alas, I left that e-mail in my Inbox, figuring that I’d be able to get to this “to-do” today, the day after Marquette’s graduation and for me the first day of “now-I-can-get-my-life-back-in-order.” But this morning I turned on my computer, fired up Outlook, and received another e-mail from the Law School Library, not another reminder, but this time an invoice indicating that I’m being charged for the book I had hitherto needed to renew! Oh, and the story doesn’t end there—take a look:

You read that correctly; the Law Library has charged me $390,205.72.

Gee, guys, couldn’t you have at least waived the Billing Fee? I should probably get this taken care of&#8230;
