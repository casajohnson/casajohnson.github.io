As academics we are part of a family of scholars, who, being human, are brittle. Our Theology family received a bracing reminder of this truth yesterday, when our beloved colleague, Lucas Chan, SJ, suddenly died here on our office floor at Marquette Hall. He was the picture of health, and just came back from his morning swim.

Lucas was an insightful and supportive colleague, always cheerful. He was to be a key part of our Department’s increased focus on its ethics section. Having just completed his first year teaching for us, he was soon to be joined by our brand new hire in ethics, Conor M. Kelly, also a Boston College product. Alas, God’s permissive will had other plans.

May God have mercy upon him, and embrace him in eternity.
