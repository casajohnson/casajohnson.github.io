title: Reginald of Piperno and the _alia lectura fratris Thome_
description: With Tolomeo of Lucca we say that Thomas Aquinas's so-called _Roman Commentary_ on Book 1 of Lombard's _Sentences_ was delivered while he was in Rome (1265–68)? Could it be from earlier? And could it be closer to Thomas than we have thought? I mean, _much_ closer?

An article that studies the relationship Thomas's trusty secretary, Reginald of Piperno, may have to the effort of his _Roman Commentary_ or, more safely called, the _alia lectura_.

Thomas appears to have commented a second time on Book 1 of Peter Lombard's _Libri sententiarum_, and possibly while at Rome, as Tolomeo of Lucca tells us; it is Tolomeo who said that Thomas 'wrote it' while Thomas was in Rome (between 1265–1268), and that he himself once saw the text when he was visiting Lucca, his home priory (though Tolomeo does not specify a date). This whole moment in Thomas's teaching career matters because it was immediately after this Roman experiment—or possibly during it—that Thomas started up the _Summa theologiae_.

Conversations with Adriano Oliva and Fabio Gibiino have encouraged me to study carefully the script of the copyists who put the text of this _alia lectura_ ("other, or second, lecture") onto the page of the manuscript that now carries it, Oxford, Lincoln College MS. Lat. 95.

## Current notes

* The copy of Thomas's Parisian _scriptum_ on Book 1 of the _Sentences_ carried in the Lincoln College manuscript is _not_ the final one copied from the Parisian booksellers, but is an earlier version thereof.
* Did Reginald's script evolve over time—and especially after his time in Paris with Thomas from 1268–1272? Can we link French (i.e., non-Italian) abbreviations in his writing only after Thomas's second Parisian regency (and Reginald's first experience)?
* Oh, yeah. It is Reginald's hand that copies the final two texts in the _alia lectura_, plus makes a severe correction to the antepenultimate article. What does this all mean?
